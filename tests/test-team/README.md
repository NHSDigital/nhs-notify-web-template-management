# NHS Notify Template Management (WebUI) Automated Regression Tests

This package includes tests for the template management UI. The tests can be run using the test:local-ui script in the package.json.

This package includes:

- component tests, which are designed to test the behaviour on individual pages, and seed template data relevant to those pages at the start of the tests
- e2e tests, which simulate a user going through the whole app.
